# Welcome to xUnit

xUnit.net is a free, open-source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework. Written by the original inventor of NUnit v2, 

xUnit.net is the latest technology for unit testing C#, F#, VB.NET, and other .NET languages.

Designed to help developers write clean, maintainable, and efficient unit tests, 

xUnit provides a modern and intuitive approach to ensuring code quality—we are also working on improved documentation to make that even easier.

With features like attribute-based test definitions, built-in dependency injection, and support for parallel test execution, 

xUnit makes it easy to write reliable tests that integrate seamlessly into your development workflow.

xUnit.net works with command-line tools, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, ReSharper/Rider, CodeRush, and NCrunch. 

It is part of the .NET Foundation, follows their code of conduct, and is licensed under Apache 2 (an OSI-approved license).
